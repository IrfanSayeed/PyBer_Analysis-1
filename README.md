# PyBer_Analysis

## **Background**
V. Isualize has given you and Omar a brand-new assignment. Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

### Data Source: city_data.csv, PyBer_ride_data_csv, ride_data.csv

### Software: Python 3.7.10 , Jupyter Notebook

## **Overview of the analysis:**
The purpose of the analysis is to gain insights on how to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods

## **Results:**

Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.

## **Summary:**

Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
