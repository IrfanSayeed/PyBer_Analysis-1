# PyBer_Analysis

## **Background**
V. Isualize has given you and Omar a brand-new assignment. Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

### **Data Source:** 
city_data.csv, PyBer_ride_data_csv, ride_data.csv

### **Software:**
Python 3.7.10 , Jupyter Notebook

## **Overview of the analysis:**
The purpose of the analysis is to gain insights on how to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

## **Results:**

Analysis shows that while urban ride sharing represents 62.7% of all fares generated,  this large percentage is generated by the sheer volume of rides and available drivers in urban centres.   The average fare per ride in Urban centres is $24.53 which is 29.2% ($10.09) lower than that of Rural and 20.8% ($6.44) than that of Suburban fares.

## **Summary:**

Based on the results, below are three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
1. Further exploritory data is needed to assist in understanding the business drivers for the disparities amoung city types such as:
        *  kilometres per ride
        *  passengers per ride
        *  weather at time per ride
        *  population per city type
        *  number of cars on the road per city type
        *  competitors per city type/ alternative public transportation means per city type
