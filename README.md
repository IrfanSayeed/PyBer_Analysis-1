# PyBer_Analysis (Module 5 Challenge)

## **Background / Requirements**
V. Isualize has given you and Omar a brand-new assignment. Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

### **Source:** 
- Python (Jupyter Note Book) 
- city_data.csv, PyBer_ride_data_csv, ride_data.csv (saved in folder "\Source)

## 1. ** Overview of the analysis: **
The purpose of this analysis is to review the PyBer rides data to have a better understanding of the ridership and fare metrics (Urban vs Rurel).

## 2. **Results: **

### Ride Sharing Data by City Type Summary


Analysis identified that urban ride sharing represents highest (62.7%) of all fares generated, key reason for this large percentage is volume of riders and more drivers in urban centers. The average fare per ride in Urban centres is $24.53 which is 29.2% ($10.09) lower than that of Rural and 20.8% ($6.44) than that of Suburban fares. Reason for this is due to high frequency of rides within short distance which generate more min fare and less accumulated distance.

## **Summary / Recommendations: **

High fuel price, Expensive electric vehicle, inflation, grid locks, weather and pandemic fears are keeping people within their vicinity. Low cost and fair practice services will encourage people to use ride sharing transportation. Part time drivers try to make more money in short time and so we can not expect good customer services. Sooner or later, more peoples will be choosing to work from home or only goto work for physical and technical assistance.   

> Based on the comparative analysis, below are some business recommendations to PyBer SLTs:
1. Attract more rider by discounts and promo such as free rides after certain numbers of ride or total fares in dollars
2. Introduce Tier base pricing i.e. more your ride within a time frame get cheaper rate per KM
3. Add premium during rush hours and applicable min fare for short distances
4. Also Introduce no-passenger rides, pickup/delivery, city tour, hospital appointment service, carpooler assistance etc. 
5. Offer more incentive to drivers who work during non rush hours and accept long haul drives
6. Introduce Rural to Urban and vice versa rids for daily commuter
7. Incorouge drivers to provide advance schedule to avoid low or high driver counts at certain point. This will help to catch more business and satisfied drivers.
